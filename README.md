# ROBO-ARM-BASED-PROSTHETIC-FOOD-FEEDING-DEVICE-
 Food feeding device for physically challenged people with help of robotic arm.
          The main objective of the proposed work is to design a self-feeding device with
improved performance. This project is mainly used to reduce the work of caregivers and to
make comfort for physically challenged persons. The project concentrates on the design and
development of an economical and user-friendly feeding system for physically challenged
peoples.
           The proposed solution consists of a robotic arm and a mechanical setup. Arduino
controls the arm movement and Atmega controls the bowl movement. The movements of the
robotic arm are done by the servo motors. Servo motors are commonly used for angular
rotation. Based on the user's need the Arduino is programmed and the servo motors are
rotated on the desired angle to feed the food. In order to feed the entire food in the bowl a
mechanical setup was developed to tilt the bowl. At first the bowl weight was sensed by load
cell and the initial weight was displayed in the LCD. Whenever a certain percentage of the
weight in the bowl is reduced the bowl will be tilted using wiper motor. The wiper motor was
work based on the signal from the Atmega controller. After tilting the bowl a switch near to
the users feet was pressed to change the movement of robotic arm.
